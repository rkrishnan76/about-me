# about-me
I am working with wd for the past 1.5 months as an engineer.  Before that I was with oracle as a hands-on manager. 

In workday, we are working on a prop. Tech XO.  it is built using java and xml

In Oracle, I was leading a team of 5.  We used adf framework which is also based of java, plsql.  i was initially n India.  I was transferred here to play a greater role in continuous integration, analyzing latest tech architecture change proposals and rolling out to the team etcâ€¦

The reason I am looking for change is, @ wd the development using xo is an alternative of regular coding.  Over the past 1.5 months I realized my creativity and out of box thinking can be impacted due to the limitations of the framework.

The reason I switched from Oracle, I was with Oracle over 15 years.  I moved to US taking new responsibilities but before leaving oracle, I was asked to be customer escalations POC.  It was a nice role initially, but soon I was getting into a position where I was getting too far off from coding and problem solving.  So, I wanted to try new challenges instead of living in a comfort zone.
