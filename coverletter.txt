
I have over 16 years of experience in IT and 13+ years in Enterprise application Product Development.

I have played multiple roles in my 16 years of experience.  I have managed a development team, mentored new joinees, been a tech lead and most recently I have completed SCRUM Master certification and 
playing the SCRUM Master role.

I have been known as a smart and hard worker and excellent team player.  I not only make sure my team put in extra efforts during the crisis I also put more effort if not equal to ensure we meet the deadlines.

Product managers appreciate the attention I give to the finer details of the future.  I get excited in solving complex problems and joy in delivering them in high quality.

I believe as Senior Manager, I can use all my skills to lead and motivate the team in delivering high quality solutions.

Looking forward to hear from you.
