I have been working in Oracle US for the last 6 yrs where in the last 1 year I am working in oracle latest Fsuion technology which is based on ADF framework which is based on java and plsql.
Ealier to that I worked across oracle ebiz crm products like Quoting , OrderCapture , pricing , Order Managememnt, Field Service , istore and explored them with great functional

Where do you see yourself in five years? .
-----------------------------------------

’m really excited by this position at Midnight Consulting because in five years, I’d like to be seen as someone with deep expertise 
in the energy sector, and I know that’s something that I’ll have an opportunity to do here. 
I’m also really excited to take on more managerial responsibilities in the next few years and potentially even take the 
lead on some projects. I’ve been lucky enough to work with some amazing managers, and so developing into a great manager myself is 
something I’m really excited about.”
