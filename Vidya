I have over 15 years of experience in IT and 10+ years in Enterprise  Product application Development.

I have been working in Oracle US for the last 6 yrs where in the last 1 year I am working in oracle latest Fsuion technology which is based on ADF framework which is based on java and plsql.
Ealier to that I worked across oracle ebiz crm products like Quoting , OrderCapture , pricing , Order Managememnt, Field Service , istore and explored them with great functional
understanding and worked on many enhacements and customer issues and bugs. 

Earlier to that I was based in oracle India and I was transferred here to play a greater role in continuous integration, analyzing latest tech architecture change proposals and rolling out to the team etcâ€¦

The reason I am looking for change is,I explored all the possible challenges with great satisfaction over the last 10 years and I am looking out for new challenges to expand my career development 
and growth.This position really excites me
